# Employee_Manager

## Description

Using mySQL, Node.js, and NPM packages, I created a node based application that tracks employees. The employees and their job related functions are kept up-to-date in mySQL databases. The dynamic functionality is created in JavaScript. Node, which is using Express and mysql dependincies is where the user will interface with the application.
